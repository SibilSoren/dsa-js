# Interview Prep Session

Use this workflow for focused problem-solving with interview mentor guidance.

## Steps

1. **Select a Problem**
   - Choose from NeetCode 150, LeetCode, or a specific pattern to practice
   - Paste the problem name or link

2. **Activate the Interview Prep Skill**
   - The skill will act as a Senior/Staff FAANG engineer mentor
   - It will ask you to explain your approach FIRST before showing any code

3. **Explain Your Approach**
   - Think aloud about what pattern this reminds you of
   - Identify the key insight or invariant
   - Discuss time/space complexity

4. **Refine with Feedback**
   - The mentor will point out exactly where your logic breaks
   - Focus on WHY something works, not just WHAT to do
   - Connect to patterns you've seen before

5. **Write Code** (only after intuition is clear)
   - Clean, interview-ready JavaScript
   - Handle edge cases
   - Verify complexity

6. **Document the Solution**
   - Use the problem template: `.agent/skills/interview-prep/templates/PROBLEM_TEMPLATE.md`
   - Update `PROGRESS.md` with the new problem
