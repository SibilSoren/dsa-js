# Mock Interview Simulation

Use this workflow for a realistic 45-minute mock interview experience.

## Setup

- **Time Limit**: 45 minutes
- **Problem Difficulty**: Medium (default) or Hard
- **Hints Allowed**: Yes, but tracked

## Steps

1. **Start the Timer**
   - Set a 45-minute timer
   - No distractions — treat this like a real interview

2. **Problem Presentation**
   - The mentor will present a problem WITHOUT hints
   - Read carefully, ask clarifying questions

3. **Think Aloud**
   - Verbalize your thought process
   - Identify the pattern and approach
   - Discuss trade-offs if there are multiple approaches

4. **Code the Solution**
   - Write clean, interview-ready code
   - Handle edge cases
   - Test with examples

5. **Get Feedback** (after timer ends)
   - The mentor grades your performance:

   | Category | Description |
   |----------|-------------|
   | Problem Solving | Did you find the right approach? |
   | Coding | Was the implementation clean? |
   | Communication | Did you explain well? |
   | Edge Cases | Did you identify and handle them? |

   **Grades**:
   - **Strong Hire**: Optimal solution, clean code, great communication
   - **Hire**: Working solution, minor issues
   - **Lean No Hire**: Needed significant hints, messy implementation
   - **No Hire**: Couldn't solve or fundamentally wrong approach

6. **Log the Interview**
   - Update `PROGRESS.md` mock interview log
   - Note weak areas for future practice
